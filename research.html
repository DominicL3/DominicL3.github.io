								<h2>Classifying Fast Radio Bursts and Radio Frequency Interference with Convolutional Neural Networks</h2>

								<p>During my time at Berkeley, I had the pleasure of doing research in the Department of Astronomy under Dr. Vishal Gajjar,
									a postdoc with the Breakthrough Listen team. <a href="https://seti.berkeley.edu">Breakthrough Listen's</a> main objective
									is to search for signals of intelligent life—not too shabby of a project to partake in as an undergrad.</p>

								<h4>Fast Radio Bursts</h4>

								<p>Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are one of the most mysterious objects in astrophysics. Powerful radio pulses lasting a few milliseconds at max,
									no one knows their origins, and their sources can't be tracked and studied further because they usually come once and never again from the
									same place. Current theories for progenitors include neutron star collisions, ridiculously energetic supernovae (very cool), and the collapse
									of the magnetospheres of supermassive black holes.</p>

								<p>Some people think it could be aliens. If I were to put money on it, it's probably not.</p>

								<p><b>[EDIT 1/23/2020]</b> Recently, astronomers have been building observational evidence converging on <i>magnetars</i> as the source of these fast radio bursts.
									<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetar"> Magnetars </a> are stars that have completed the main portion of their life fusing hydrogen into helium
									and have collapsed into neutron stars with extreme magnetic field environments. Although we are closing in on a source, it's still a mystery as to <i>how</i> these
									terrific bursts of electromagnetic radiation are generated.

								<p>To study these strange phenomena, Vishal designed a pipeline to search for FRB
									pulses from from the Green Bank and Parkes, two of the largest radio telescopes
									in the world. Unfortunately, a major problem for current detection software is
									radio frequency interference (RFI). Emissions like WiFi and microwave ovens would
									very likely be mistaken for an FRB, so the pipeline accepts many false candidates.</p>

								<h4>Differentiating FRBs from RFI</h4>

								<p>My project focused on developing a binary classification model that would be able to
									distinguish RFI from FRBs and whittle down the number of candidates that a human had
									to check. I tackled this problem with convolutional neural networks, inspired by
									the approach in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03084">Connor & van Leeuwen (2018)</a>.</p>

								<p>Training data for FRBs is sparse, with currently only a few hundred real examples at most.
									Because neural networks require huge amounts of data to be effective, we decided to simulate
									them in the same way that Connor & van Leeuwen did. Here are a few of the results:</p>

								<figure>
									<center>
										<img src="images/research_plots/sample_simulated_frbs.png" alt="" style="width:80%">
										<figcaption>Spectrograms of simulated FRBs (left) with their corresponding signals (right).</figcaption>
									</center>
								</figure>

								<p>After training and debugging, testing the model's performance on known FRBs delivered
									good results, and the model was able to pick out most pulses. Below are samples of
									predicted FRBs that the model was highly confident in (> 95% probability).</p>

										<figcaption>Spectrograms of <b>real</b> FRBs in Breakthrough Listen data. The second image is a false positive.</figcaption>
									</center>
								</figure>

								<p>Because we cared more about finding every single FRB, I weighted the network such that
									it penalized false negatives, leading to a higher recall but greater chance of
									false positives. You can see a false positive in the second prediction, which
									has no signal in it, even though the model thought it did.</p>

								I created multiple models, each trained on different simulated parameters depending on the
								telescope and what characteristic data from that telescope would look like. As of now, my
								models are integrated in Vishal's pipeline, happily sifting out that pesky RFI.

								<h3>Other Research</h3>

								<h4>Stellar shock waves</h4>

								<p>My previous research involved working with Dr. Stephen Ro to study how shock waves
									propagated through stars in order to determine the origins of false supernovae.
									The premier code to simulate stellar conditions, MESA, had recently included hydrodynamics
									in its physics repertoire. By simulating explosions in stars—"setting off bombs,"
									as Stephen would call it—and watching how the shocks traveled, I verified that MESA's
									new hydrodynamics calculations complied with theoretical predictions.</p>

								<h4>Stellar nucleosynthesis in tidal disruption events</h4>

								<p>My first research experience at Berkeley also dealt with MESA and was also very cool.
									Dr. Ken Shen and I were exploring stellar nucleosynthesis, the energy-production process
									by which stars fuse lighter elements to make heavier ones. Specifically, we were looking
									at what would happen to nucleosynthesis if we threw a star deep towards a black hole,
									causing it to be squeezed a ton and wildly increasing its density and temperature.
									This is known as a tidal disruption event, when the star is ripped apart and spaghettified
									by the tidal forces close to a black hole.</p>

								<p>After getting rough numbers for the pressure, temperature, and density a star would encounter
									upon tidal disruption, I conducted simulations in MESA to investigate the fusion reactions
									taking place within the star.</p>
